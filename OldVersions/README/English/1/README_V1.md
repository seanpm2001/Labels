### Notices

#### 2024 January 1st

**Public labels**

As of 2024.01.01, I am no longer including `txt` `md` `gpl3` `gplv3` as valid repository tags, unless the repository is at least 50% related to them (the repository being written in Markdown or Plain Text alone doesn't count) I will begin removing these after documenting them into the RepoData directories of the repositories in question.

!Make this all alphabetical!
```

Some labels were removed in the final draft, mostly the historian labels, as they are inappropriate to use with my field. History buff supercedes all these labels. Some other too-personal attributes were also removed. Also note that the original draft was written after midnight, and while under the influence of sleeping medications.
